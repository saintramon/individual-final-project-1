Computer Programming 2
Final Exercise 3


Please open the pdf file called IndividualFinalProjectSpecification_GeometricMeasurements.pdf. The specification has helpful diagrams that may be seen clearly
through the pdf file.

Be reminded that you have to follow programming conventions and you have to provide documentations
through comments (Present an algorithm through multiline comments where appropriate).

For your convenience, the source codes for the needed Interface and Reference classes
are provided in zipped project folder named  FinalExercise3. You can just unzipped and use the
project folder such that you will not need to re-encode those that are already given.


FOR THIS EXERCISE, JUST UPLOAD YOUR main class ( i.e. just upload <YourName>Tester2.java ).
When I will evaluate/check/test your main class, I will be using my codes for the needed Interface and Reference classes.
